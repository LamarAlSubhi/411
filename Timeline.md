# Travel Memory Journal Project Guide

## 1. Project Setup:
- **Version Control**: Use a system like Git. Host your repository on platforms like GitHub or GitLab.
- **Tech Stack**: Consider the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) for simplicity.

## 2. Backend Development:
### Server:
- Set up a basic Express.js server.
### Database:
- Use MongoDB to create schemas for user profiles, trips, and potentially cached API data.
### API Integration:
- Create functions to fetch data from weather and history APIs.
- Add routes to serve these API requests.

## 3. Frontend Development:
### React Framework:
- Set up a basic app using Create React App.
### Components:
- `UserProfile`: Manage user details and saved trips.
- `TripInput`: Input trip details.
- `WeatherRecap`: Display weather data.
- `WorldEventsTimeline`: Show significant events.
- `PhotoIntegration`: Upload and overlay images.
- `Share`: Share and export memories.

## 4. APIs:
- Research your chosen weather and history API documentation.
- Determine how to request data based on date and location.
- Account for potential API rate limits. Consider caching frequent data.

## 5. Decoupling:
- Ensure frontend communicates only with your backend, not directly with external APIs.
- Use modular code: separate functionalities into reusable components/functions.

## 6. Testing:
- Write unit tests for backend routes and helper functions.
- Consider Jest for React component testing.

## 7. Styling:
- Plan UI/UX using tools like Figma or Adobe XD.
- Use CSS tools like Bootstrap or Styled Components for styling.

## 8. Deployment:
- Deploy the backend on platforms like Heroku or Vercel.
- Consider Netlify for frontend deployment.

## 9. Additional Considerations:
### Authentication:
- Implement using libraries like Passport.js.
### Error Handling:
- Handle backend (e.g., failed API calls) and frontend (e.g., invalid input) errors.
### Optimization:
- Cache data, reduce API calls, and consider data pagination.
